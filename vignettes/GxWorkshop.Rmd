## Workshop Description

This workshop will focus on the synergies between analysis results from the PharmacoGx, Xeva and RadioGx packages and their usefulness for discovery of biomarkers of drug and/or radiation sensitivity in cancer cell lines (CCLs) and patent derived xenograft models (PDXs). We will discuss issues with data curation, consistency and reproducibility within the literature as well as illustrate the importance of unified analytical platforms, data and code sharing in bioinformatics and biomedical research. In this lab learners will be led through an analysis for each of the three packages on data provided by the download functions within them. The results of these analyses will then be explored to highlight how drug and radiation dose-response profiles in CCLs and PDXs can be used to discover potential synergistic biomarkers for drug-radiation and drug combination therapies. The resulting biomarkers will be discussed in the context of translational cancer research and clinical applications of genomic data. We will conclude with a discussion of how these biomarkers can be used to inform future in vitro and in vivo treatment screenings and ultimately provide useful insights for clinical trial design.

### Workshop Participation

Participants expected to have the following required packages installed on their machines to be able to run the commands along with the instructors.
PharmacoGx,  Xeva, RadioGx, CoreGx and Biobase from Bioconductor
The workshop will be presented as a set of analysis steps to be replicated by the learners, with instructors available to explain the why and how of applying these functions to the given datasets. Learners will write analysis scripts as well as use interactive commands to explore the generated data structures and results. Learners will then brainstorm potential applications of the analysis results in their field as well as comment on use case examples presented by the instructors on research in our lab.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
