## Workshop Description

This workshop will focus on the synergies between analysis results from the PharmacoGx, Xeva and RadioGx packages and their usefulness for discovery of biomarkers of drug and/or radiation sensitivity in cancer cell lines (CCLs) and patent derived xenograft models (PDXs). We will discuss issues with data curation, consistency and reproducibility within the literature as well as illustrate the importance of unified analytical platforms, data and code sharing in bioinformatics and biomedical research. In this lab learners will be led through an analysis for each of the three packages on data provided by the download functions within them. The results of these analyses will then be explored to highlight how drug and radiation dose-response profiles in CCLs and PDXs can be used to discover potential synergistic biomarkers for drug-radiation and drug combination therapies. The resulting biomarkers will be discussed in the context of translational cancer research and clinical applications of genomic data. We will conclude with a discussion of how these biomarkers can be used to inform future in vitro and in vivo treatment screenings and ultimately provide useful insights for clinical trial design.

## Introduction
This tutorial, titled Biomarker Discovery from High Throughput Screening Datasets, focuses on a suite of packages designed to 
simplify analysis correlating measures of treatment response measured on model systems with molecular profiles of those systems.
These packages primarly focus on modeling response to cancer treatments in cancer models, but the concepts presented can be 
applied to other disease types, given availability of data for the area of interest. 

The first two of the packages, `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("RadioGx")` focus on screens done 
using cell lines as a model system. PharmacoGx focuses on modeling and predicting the response of cell lines treated with small 
molecule therapies. RadioGx swaps the small molecule treatment for irradiation of cell lines. The third package, 
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("Xeva")`, looks at treatment response for _in vivo_ systems, primarily Patient Derived Xenographs of cancer
tumours growing in immune compromised mice. 


## Data Structure and Common Functions Between Packages

While the experiments analyzed by the three packages are different, the workflow that these packages are designed to accommodate
has many similarities between them. First and foremost, all three pacakges were developed to provide 



## Basic Functionalities of PharmacoGx

`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` was developed to serve as a platform for
integrating analysis across different pharmacogenomic datasets. The main focus of the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")` package is to provide access to
pharmacogenomics datasets that have been preprocessed with a uniform pipeline,
and extensively curated to ensure maximum overlap and consistency. The package is designed around
on a level of abstraction from the raw experimental data, and
allows bioinformaticians and biologists to work with data at the level of genes,
drugs and cell lines. This provides a more intuitive interface and, in
combination with unified curation, simplifies analyses between multiple
datasets. The purpose of this section is to familiarize the reader with the basic design of a
high throughput drug screen, introduce the PSet, an object which stores all the data
related to a pharmacogenomics study, and introduces the datasets which we will be using in 
this tutorial. 


## Basic Functionalities of RadioGx

### Installing RadioGx

To install the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('RadioGx')` package, run:

```{r install_radiogx, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('bhklab/RadioGx')
# BiocManager::install('RadioGx', version='devel') # Waiting on issue with Bioconductor credentials to be resolved so I can push updates
```

```{r load_package, message=FALSE}
library(RadioGx)
```

### RadioSet

The RadioSet has a structure similar to the `PharmacoSet` and also inherits
from the CoreSet class exported by `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('CoreGx')`. The radiation
slot is implemented in `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('RadioGx')`  to hold relevant metadata
about the type(s) of radiation used in the dose-response experiment,
and is analogous to the drug slot in a `PharmacoSet`. The remainder of the slots
mirror the `PharmacoSet`.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = "**Fig. N: RadioSet class diagram**"}
knitr::include_graphics('./RadioGxClassDiagram.png')
```

### Downloading an RSet

`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('RadioGx')` provides an interface similar to `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("PharmacoGx")`
and `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('Xeva')` for downloading our curated versions of published datasets.

To get a list of available `RadioSet`s, use:

```{r available_rsets}
RSets <- availableRSets()
```

```{r available_radiosets_table, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(RSets[, c("RadioSet_name", "Date_updated", "DOI")])
```

As the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('RadioGx')` package was only recently released, there is
currently only one dataset available. Let's download the 'Cleveland' RSet, which contains
a highly curated version of the data from Yang *et al.*, 2016.

```{r download_rset}
Cleveland <- downloadRSet('Cleveland', saveDir='.')
```

```{r printing_a_radioset, hide=TRUE}
Cleveland
```

Similar to PharmacoGx and Xeva, a summary of the contents of the RadioSet is printed
when calling a RadioSet in the console. We can see that the Cleveland RSet contains
sensitivity information for 540 cell-lines treated with a single type of radiation.
The RSet also contains rna(microarray), rna-seq and cnv molecular data for a subset of available
cell-lines.

### Accessing Data

RadioGx stores three major categories of data: metadata/annotations, molecular data and radiation response data.
These are demarcated in *Fig N* using green, blue and red, respectively. Accessor methods are available
to retrieve all three kinds of data from an RSet; the accessor methods for each component are listed
in the bottom most cell of each object in the RadioGx class diagram. We will discuss a subset of these methods
now.

1. Accessing metadata

Metadata in an RSet is stored in the same slots as in a PharmacoSet, and can be accessed using the same
generic accessor functions as in PharmacoGx. A unique slot, `radiation` has additional accessor methods
to retrieve the radiation types used in a given sensitivity experiment.

```{r radiation_info_accessor}
# Get the radiation info data.frame from an RSet
radInf <- radiationInfo(Cleveland)
```

```{r print_radinf}
knitr::kable(head(radInf))
```
Currently, only one type of radiation has been used in an RSet. However, we hope to add new RSets covering a wider range of
sensitivity and perturbation experiments in the near future. The following method is also available to retrieve the radiation
types as a `character` vector instead of a `data.frame`.

```{r radiation_types_accessor}
radTypes <- radiationTypes(Cleveland)
radTypes
```
2. Accessing molecular data

Molecular data in an RSet is contained in the `molecularProfiles` slot and can be accessed the same way it is for a PSet.

```{r molecular_data_slot_accessors}
# Get the list (equivalent to @molecularProfiles, except that it is robut to changes in RSet structure
str(molecularProfilesSlot(Cleveland), max.level=2)

# Get the names from the list
mDataNames(Cleveland)
```

All molecular data in an RSet (any class inheriting from CoreSet, actually) is contained in a `SummarizedExperiment`
object. While `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('SummarizedExperiment')` comes with it's own set of accessors, we recommend using
available `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg('RadioGx')` accessor methods as it allows your scripts to be robust to future changes
in the structure of a `RadioSet` object.

```{r sample_meta_data}
# Get sample metadata
phenoInf <- phenoInfo(Cleveland, 'cnv')
```

```{r print_sample_meta_data}
knitr::kable(head(phenoInf))
```


```{r feature_meta_data}
# Get feature metadata
featInfo <- featureInfo(Cleveland, 'rna')
```

```{r print_feature_meta_data}
knitr::kable(head(featInfo))
```


```{r molecular_data}
# Access the moleclar feature data
mProf <- molecularProfiles(Cleveland, 'rnaseq')
```

```{r print_molecular_profile_data}
knitr::kable(head(mProf))
```


3. Accessing response data

Data from radiation sensitivity and/or perturbation experiments is also retrieved the same way it is for a PSet. Currently,
only sensitivity experiments have been included in a RadioSet.

```{r response_data_accessors}
# Get sensitivity slot

```

### Fitting the Linear Quadratic (LQ) Model

RadioGx provides a number of functions for analyzing dose response experiments.
To use these functions, we must first fit a statistical model to the dose
response data. This package exports a function for fitting linear-quadratic
models to dose response data. The function can be used with data contained in
a RadioSet or with raw dose-response data.

```{r model_fit}
# Extract raw sensitvity data from the RadioSet
sensRaw <- sensitivityRaw(Cleveland)
paste('Third dimension:', paste0(dimnames(sensRaw)[[3]], collapse=', '))
```
```{r structure_sensitivity_raw}
str(sensRaw)
```

The data returned by `sensitivityRaw(RSet)` is a three dimensional
array, but it can also be thought of as a set of experiment by treatment
matrices. We can see by the `dimnames` of the third dimensions that
the first matrix holds the radiation dose (in Gy) for each experiment,
while the second matrix holds the viability measurements for the cell-line
after each dose in the experimental series.

```{r cellline_names}
# Find a cancer cell-line of interest
head(sensitivityInfo(Cleveland)$cellid)
```

```{r selecting_cancer_cell_line}
cancerCellLine <- sensitivityInfo(Cleveland)$cellid[1]
print(cancerCellLine)
```

```{r extracting_dose_response_data}
# Get the radiation doses and associated survival data from clevelandSmall
radiationDoses <- sensRaw[1, , 'Dose']
survivalFractions <- sensRaw[1, , 'Viability']
```

```{r fitting_lq_model}
LQmodel <- linearQuadraticModel(D=radiationDoses,
                                SF=survivalFractions)
LQmodel
```

Above we see that LQmodel contains the alpha and beta coefficients for the dose
response curve fit to the dose and viability data for the IMR-32 cancer cell-line.
Based on the $R^2$ attribute we can see that the model fit for this data is
good, with over 95% of observed variance explained by the model.

### Calculating Dose-Response Metrics

RadioGx provides a number of functions for calculating common dose response
metrics such as survival fraction (SF), area under the curve (AUC) and dose at
which only 10% of cancer cells survive (D10).

Some of these functions require the alpha and beta coefficients, as calculated
above using the `linearQuadraticModel` function.

```{r metrics_computed_from_fit_parameters}
survFracAfter2Units <- computeSF2(pars=LQmodel)
print(survFracAfter2Units)

dose10PercentSurv <- computeD10(pars=LQmodel)
print(dose10PercentSurv)
```
We see from the above code cell that after two units of radiation, approximately
`r (100 * survFracAfter2Units)` of cancer cells remain relative to the initial population.
Conversely, using `computeD10` we see that on average `r dose10PercentSurv` units of radiation
need to be administered to result in 10% cell-line survival (i.e., 90% of cancer cells
are killed).

Other dose-response metrics can be computed directly using radiation dose
and cancer cell viability data.

```{r metrics_computed_from_dose_response_data}
areaUnderDoseRespCurve <- computeAUC(D=radiationDoses, pars=LQmodel, lower=0,
                                     upper=1)
print(areaUnderDoseRespCurve)

survFrac <- 1 - areaUnderDoseRespCurve
print(survFrac)
```

In the above code block we compute the AUC for a dose-response curve between a
dose of 0 to 1 Gy. This area can be interpreted as the proportion of cells
killed during the administration of 1 Gy of radiation, therefore the survival
fraction is equal to 1 - AUC. We see that 1 Gy of radiation killed
`r (100 * areaUnderDoseRespCurve)` of cancer cell-line colonies, thus our
surviving fraction is `r (100 * survFrac)` or `surFrac`.

### Dose-Response Curves

The `doseResponseCurve` function can be used to generate plots of survival
fraction vs dose for radiation sensitivity experiments. In this example
we provide raw data values to create the plot. When the `plot.type` is set to
"Both", a linear-quadratic model will also be fit to the supplied dose-response
values.

```{r plotting_rad_dose_resp}
doseResponseCurve(
  Ds=list("Experiment 1" = c(0, 2, 4, 6)),
  SFs=list("Experiment 1" = c(1,.6,.4,.2)),
  plot.type="Both"
  )
```

Additionally, `doseResponseCurve` can be used to create dose response curves
directly from a curated RadioSet object. When utilizing this feature, a
cell-line must be selected from the RadioSet. This can be done by name
if you know which cell-line you are looking for. If you don't know which
cell-line you want to visualize, the available
cell-lines can be explored using the `cellInfo` function.

```{r plotting_rad_dose_resp_rSet}
doseResponseCurve(
  rSets=list(clevelandSmall),
  cellline=cellInfo(clevelandSmall)$cellid[3]
)
```
